## Create trap files  
2018: 2018TrapFileCode and McKTracksOnepersonpertrack.csv  
*Status - Code from a previous version of Tioga 2018TrapFile Code was pasted in here but has not been updated to McKenzie object names or use McKenzie files. I would use the current Tioga 2018TrapFile.R, 2019TrapFile.R or SegmentTransects_2018 as a template to segment transects to 300 meters.*  

2019: 2019TrapFileCode and 2019McKenzieTracksCombined.csv  
*Status - Code from a previous version of Tioga 2018TrapFile Code was pasted in here but has not been updated to McKenzie object names or use McKenzie files. I would use the current Tioga 2018TrapFile.R, 2019TrapFile.R or SegmentTransects_2018 as a template to segment transects to 300 meters.*  
This is the messiest code of all the scripts...  

## Create capture history files 
2018: 2018McKCaptHistFileCode.R and 2018McKElkLocations.csv  
2019: 2019McKCaptHistFileCode.R and 2019McKenzieSampleCoordinatesUTMIndividualsAdded.csv  
*Note: To match Tioga process, use SegmentTransects_2018.R and SegmentTransects_2019.R to create capture histories*

## Telemetry information  
2018: 2018McKTelemetry.txt and 2018McKTelemetry.Reduced.txt where the reduced version is 300 points total.  
2019: 2019McKTelemetry.txt and 2019MckTelemetry.Reduced.txt where the reduced version is 300 points total.
*Note: We fixed sigma when we ran models to appease computational capabilities. The fixed sigma was estimated with this data, though.*
